# The Curious Case of South Africa's Income Inequality

### This visualization investigates South Africa's high income inequality with three visualizations to help decipher its curious case of recently having recorded one of the highest income inequality in the world.

### Abstract
Most of the Sub-saharan African countries have a very different economic composition than South Africa's. While most SSA countries' Gini correlates with education and agriculture, South Africa has a very high literacy rate and very low agricultural composition. In the first visualization, we see all countries with a recorded Gini coefficient of 70 or higher which happens to consist of eight African countries with South Africa being the most recent to join those ranks. This visualization charts a possible political event that may help explain why that specific country reached a Gini coefficient of 70 or higher during that year. The second and third visualizations look at two countries (Ethiopia and Tanzania) that have been case studies in the recent UNDP report, *Income Inequality Trends in sub-Saharan Africa: Divergence, Determinants and Consequences*. With the analysis of these two countries, I hope to paint a path of analysis that might help to explain South Africa's high inequality.

This is an investigative visualization using qualitative data for a closer read into the UNDP report, while trying to redirect the qualitative analysis to start a conversation on recommendations for South Africa. It seems that with a drive away from agriculture and towards services (which seems inevitable with higher education rates), inequality rises exponentially, so a close read into South Africa's economy may help prevent high inequality in the development of other SSA countries.

###Methodology
The political information was subjectively extracted from three sources (Wikipedia, Britannica, and Freedom House) that provided non-partisan general information about that year and country. I chose information that I thought was the most significant political event in the given time period.

The qualitiative data parsing from the report was hand-picked according to their relevance to the data points listed in the table and its utility in explaining some of the big topic issues covered throughout the report that I felt might help map South Africa's specific case.

As this is an investigation, I encourage users to read further into the report with my hope being that this visualization inspires one to think about and further investigate the factors involved in South Africa's high income inequality, but also with a lens of the growing development of SSA.
