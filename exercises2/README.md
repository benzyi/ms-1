### Abstract
The years demarcated have a very strong political history in the years leading to their highest level of inequality, and all have also seen their most equal times in the years ahead except one country. South Africa had seen their most equal time in the years leading to the end of the apartheid, while being the only country to have gotten more unequal since their lowest Gini score. It is a bit mysterious as to what impactful events happened in the years leading to 2011, but looking at the UNDP Report as well as further research might help to shape an explanation that might also help find a solution to this high level of inequality.

Add info about ZA GDP compared to the rest -- to show their level of development and the cashflow.

Add more information about ZA politics leading up to the 2009 election and post election.
